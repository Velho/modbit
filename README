Network framework :
Currently builds on Windows platform, but Linux support
can be easily added through the build system. Due to lack
of functioning Linux machine Windows is sadly an option.
Linux implementation through Posix or either BSD.

Testing : 
What is left as TODO is adding UnitTest coverage. I've
found that GTest & GMock are pretty good libraries for
testing invidual classes and functionalities which I
would've chosen for this project.
Currently testing is done through implementation process
which is quite bad approach..
